- âš¡ Fun fact: 
     Neptune takes 165 years to complete one full orbit around the Sun. Since it was discovered in 1846, Neptune only finished its first full post-discovery orbit in 2011.
     Demoted planet Pluto has yet to match this â€“ it is not even close to completing one full, 248-year orbit since its discovery in 1930.
