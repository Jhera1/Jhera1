## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Justin Armstrong, a full-stack developer with a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Node.js, and a versatile background that spans software engineering, hardware repair, and even healthcare. I recently built a Concert Tracker Chrome extension that won second place in a hackathon, showcasing my skills in DOM manipulation, API integration, and user interface design. My experience also includes developing dynamic web apps, such as a PokÃ©mon data site with real-time carousel functionality, and a command-line calculator in Node.js. Iâ€™m passionate about solving real-world problems with technology in projects that require creativity and technical expertise."

- âš¡ Fun fact: 
     Neptune takes a whopping 165 years to complete one full orbit around the Sun. Since it was discovered in 1846, Neptune only finished its first full post-discovery orbit in 2011.
     Demoted planet Pluto has yet to match this â€“ it is not even close to completing one full, 248-year orbit since its discovery in 1930.
