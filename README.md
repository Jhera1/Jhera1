    Hi there ðŸ‘‹
    <p>
        My name is Justin Armstrong, a full-stack developer with a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Node.js, and a versatile background that spans software engineering, hardware repair, and even healthcare, showcasing my skills in DOM manipulation, API integration, and user interface design. My experience also includes developing dynamic web apps, such as a PokÃ©mon data site with real-time carousel functionality, and a command-line calculator in Node.js. Iâ€™m passionate about solving real-world problems with technology in projects that require creativity and technical expertise.

        <li>âš¡ Fun fact: Neptune takes 165 years to complete one full orbit around the Sun. Since it was discovered in 1846, Neptune only finished its first full post-discovery orbit in 2011. Demoted planet Pluto has yet to match this â€“ it is not even close to completing one full, 248-year orbit since its discovery in 1930.</li>
